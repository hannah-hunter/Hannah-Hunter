<h1>My Mom</h1>
<p>My hero is my mom, and unlike most high schoolers I am not afraid to say it. 
Sometimes I think that my Mom is superhuman. She wakes up at 3 AM to check my younger sister’s blood sugar, stays up to work on the company she launched herself, takes time at five thirty to make sure my twin sister and I get out the door, gets my younger sisters up, ready, out the door by seven, and then she starts her day job. Despite her busy schedule my Mom always manages to find time for me.</p>
<p>
My Mom is also an example of serving other people. The company my Mom founded was designed to help people deal with their insurance companies, and help them navigate the appeals process. Additionally, my Mom has spent a lot of time volunteering at various events. Most recently my Mom volunteered a race to help raise money for Carb DM and help people within the diabetic community. She is also planning on volunteering at the Diabetes Summit this year. Not only does my Mom volunteer, but she takes us along so we can learn how to help other people. My Mom’s example is contagious.  During one of my mom’s trips to India, her team set-up a day of volunteering.  The team bought a sweater for each child, and had spent time with the kids at the school.  My Mom will tell you that this was one of her favorite trips to India.
</p>
<p>
 One of my Mom’s best qualities is that she perserves and works hard at everything she does.  When my Mom wants something done she gets it done.  The most major and recent example is her company. My Mom built her company from the ground up. In her freetime, when she is not working her day job, she planned the out the logistics and operations of her company, made a presentation to speak at numerous events. Additonally she wrote the content, and built the wire frames for a webpage. Despite no outside funding, and only working on the company part time, my Mom created a startup, and I think that is pretty impressive.
