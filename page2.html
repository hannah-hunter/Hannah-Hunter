<p>As you can see from my banner, I love to travel and explore new things.  I have been many places in San Francisco, and have many more places to go.  I love the Golden Gate Bridge, shopping at Daiso Japan, eating tacos from a taco truck, taking a ferry, and China Town.  Last summer, my family took a trip through Northern California and I was able to see the Redwoods.  I plan to continue to explore everything I can in this area.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Traveling internationally is a more difficult challenge.  I am working hard to prepare for international travel. Currently I  am focusing on learning Spanish.  Next I would like to learn Russian and German. During this time I will continue to learn about other cultures and explore locally.  I love to try new restaurants sometimes learning to love new things and sometimes learning that I should not order a dish again.  My family has a rule that when we eat a new cuisine, we have try at least one new thing.  I have learned that I love pupusas, pho, all kinds of rice, frog, and spicy jelly fish. Ox tail soup, and duck tongue are not big favorites.  </p>
<br></br>
<p>In order to travel I have been researching international volunteer opportunities.  My younger sister has Type 1 Diabetes.  I have begun to volunteer at many events in San Francisco  Two weeks ago, I helped with registration at the Fun Run and will help at the 4th Annual Diabetes Summit in March.  I have learned that many countries do not have access to the same technology that keeps my sister healthy.  I have found a charity, Ayuda where teens can raise dollars and travel internationally to help at Diabetic Camps.  I need to be a little older to qualify.</p>
<br></br>
<p>I am also looking at opportunities for international travel during the interlude between college and high school. I am looking at ways to get certified to teach English in another country.  This would allow me to earn money while experiencing a new culture.  I also could go on a mission for my church.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Longer term,I am looking at careers that would allow me to travel internationally.  Both my parents have spent time outside of the US in their jobs.  I love to code and think there could be opportunities to travel internationally while I code.</p>
<br></br>
<p>I would love to receive the Jen Nathan Scholorship.  Not receiving the scholarship will postpone my timeline to travel internationally. </p>
