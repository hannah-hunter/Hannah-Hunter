<h1> The Most Important Things</h1>
<br></br>
<p>My Mom tells a story about me when I was in second grade.  Everyone in our class was really upset because our lunches were disappearing.  Depending on the day, an entire lunch would be gone or parts of everyone’s lunch would disappear.  I was livid when my Doritos were taken from my lunch, and I was determined to find the person who had stolen my treat.  It took several weeks.  Eventually the culprit was identified.  Our teacher sent a note home to our parents to let them know that the issue had been resolved.  I was not satisfied that the issue had been resolved, and kept pushing my teacher for more details.  As I discussed the issue with my teacher, it became apparent that the kid was taking our lunches because he was hungry.  Suddenly, my Doritos became less important to me.  I focused instead on always having snacks available in the classroom so that no one would have to ask for a snack, it was just available as needed.  This was one of the first times that I learned the most important thing in my life which is to focus on the things that will make a difference.  In the long run, it is not going to matter whether I drive the nicest car or wear the latest fashions, but it will matter that I took the time to fight for the under dog,to  lift someone’s spirt, or help someone when they need it most.</p>

<p>Some of my most memorable adventures in San Francisco have been helping other people.  Several times, I have walked through downtown San Francisco handing-out tolietries, socks, and hotdogs to the homeless people.  Although I always have remember thoose days as a positive experince, I am bothered by the fact that the bags run out quickly, and we do not always have enough to help everyone. Another time, my family took dinner to a group of people at Home and Hope.  That night, all seven members of my family spent the night sleeping on the gym floor with the other families.  One of the girls lost her red gel pen.  We searched for ever, but could not find the pen.  The girl was really upset.  The next day, my sister’s and I used our allowance to buy her a package of 36 gel pens and some coloring books.  She cried when we gave them to her.  The people at Home and Hope all had jobs, but had run into hard times.  The girl who lost her gel pen had a father who had a stroke and they lost their home because they could not cover their medical expenses.  Another family was there because they couldn’t afford an apartment after the husband left.  When we came back to the girl the gel pens, we also brought them some of the chili that was leftover from the previous night. We had learned that chili was this woman’s daughter’s favorite meal, and she was currently not talking to her mother. Providing a meal and some gel pens made all of the difference for these families. </p>
