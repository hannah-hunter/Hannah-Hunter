<h1>The Things I have learned from Jen's blog</h1>
    <br></br>
<ol>
<li> San Francisco is a fabulous city.  I am lucky to live here.  The Golden Gate Bridge is beautiful.</li>
<li> Do the things you love.  How many people do you know who traveled for 21 months, 157,400 miles, owned 19 Visas, and used 45 airline carriers.  This is the definition of passion.</li>
<li> Take time to enjoy the unexpected because what happens in a Moroccan Hammam stays in a Moroccan Hammam.</li>
<li> Don't be afraid to try new things.  I loved her food discoveries.  I have found a few of her discoveries in local stores, but have yet to find cheetos flavored like hamburger.</li>
<li> Be Brave - Jen's blog posts when she was traveling alone in the Middle East demonstrate her tenacity and bravery.  I aspire to be that brave.</li>
</ol>
<br></br>

<p>   I wish that I would have had an opportunity to have meet Jen in person.I know from her travel blog that we share many of the same passions.I love to explore.  Some of my best days in San Francisco have been spent wandering through San Francisco trying new things.  When we moved here three years ago, I had a bucket list of more than 50 things to do in this area.  The thing I love about this area is that when one thing is completed, there is always something new that can be added to my list. Some of my favorite things that I have done in the Bay Area are go to Chinatown, eating pupusas, and visiting the jellybean factory</p>
<br></br>
<p>I think the greatest lesson I learned from Jen was to focus on the path forward.  Jen had an incredible ability to prioritize and to figure things out.  For example, she was able to put together an incredible travel plan spanning months.  When she finished her first trip, she left again.  She didn't seem to get lost in trying to figure out the right moment, she let her passion guide her to get it done.  On her trips, things didn't always go perfectly, and she kept going.  She was not stopped by mosquitos or delayed flights, she was always able to keep going. Jen's scholarship keeps her passion alive. </p>
